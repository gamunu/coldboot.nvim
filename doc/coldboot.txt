INTRODUCTION                                                  *coldboot.nvim*

coldboot.nvim is a project to help you get started on your neovim journey.

                                                            *coldboot-is-not*
It is not:
- Complete framework for every plugin under the sun
- Place to add every plugin that could ever be useful

                                                                *coldboot-is*
It is:
- Somewhere that has a good start for the most common "IDE" type features:
    - autocompletion
    - goto-definition
    - find references
    - fuzzy finding
    - and hinting at what more can be done :)
- A place to _coldboot_ your journey.
    - You should fork this project and use/modify it so that it matches your
      style and preferences. If you don't want to do that, there are probably
      other projects that would fit much better for you (and that's great!)!
